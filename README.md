# Audio

I have been involved in processing audio data and training a deep learning model for audio classification using techniques like spectrograms and MFCCs.
Main focus was on building a model that accurately classifies audio into different categories, such as speech, music genres, or environmental sounds, through extensive training and evaluation on labeled data.
